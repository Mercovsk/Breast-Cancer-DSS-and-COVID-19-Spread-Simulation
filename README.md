# Breast-Cancer-DSS-and-COVID-19-Spread-Simulation
Project in Data Analytics and Computational Science

Breast Cancer Decision Support System

This project is about predicting a patient's breast status if they have a possibility to have a breast cancer or not
Users need to input parameters before running the system and from the inputs, the system will determine if the patient's status is malignant or benign

COVID-19 Spread Simulation

This project is about simulating the spread of viruses, COVID-19 in particular, with parameters
The project will project live simulation on how the virus will spread based on the parameters
